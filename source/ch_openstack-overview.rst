The OpenStack community is a global collaboration of developers and
cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source cloud
computing platform for public and private clouds. The project aims to
deliver feature-rich solutions for all types of clouds by being simple
to implement yet massively scalable. The technology consists of a series
of related projects delivering various components for a cloud
infrastructure solution.

OpenStack implements services for establishing
infrastructure-as-a-service released under the Apache 2.0 open source
license. The project is managed by the OpenStack Foundation, a nonprofit
corporate entity established in September 2012 that promotes, protects,
and empowers OpenStack software and its community.

This technology consists of a series of modular projects that control
large pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout
a data center, all managed through a single dashboard that gives
administrators control while empowering users to provision resources in
a self-service fashion.

OpenStack is committed to an open design and development process. The
community operates around a six-month, time-based release cycle with
frequent development milestones. For additional information, refer to
http://www.openstack.org.

OpenStack is available to be deployed on all major Linux platforms. For
additional information, refer to http://wiki.openstack.org/GetOpenStack.
