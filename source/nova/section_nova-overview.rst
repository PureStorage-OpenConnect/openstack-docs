Overview
========

The OpenStack Compute Service (Nova) is a cloud computing fabric
controller, which is the main part of an IaaS system. You can use
OpenStack Compute to host and manage cloud computing systems.

Nova is typically deployed in conjunction with other OpenStack services
(e.g. Block Storage, Object Storage, Image, etc) as part of a larger,
more comprehensive cloud infrastructure.
