Overview
========

The OpenStack Image Service (Glance) provides discovery, registration
and delivery services for disk and server images. The ability to copy or
snapshot a server image and immediately store it away is a powerful
capability of the OpenStack cloud operating system. Stored images can be
used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly and more
consistently if you are provisioning multiple servers than installing a
server operating system and individually configuring additional
services. It can also be used to store and catalog an unlimited number
of backups.
