Pure Storage's Contributions To OpenStack
=========================================

Pure Storage drivers for OpenStack Block Storage (aka Cinder) are
built into all releases of OpenStack from Juno, available from
http://www.openstack.org/software/start/.

Pure Storage has provided enhancements to the OpenStack Compute Service (Nova)
and OpenStack Image Service (Glance) projects to enhance instance
creation and storage efficiency as well.

Where possible, Pure Storage intends to (and has to date) contribute
integrations upstream in OpenStack directly. Pure Storageâ€™s direct
contributions to OpenStack date back to the Juno release.
