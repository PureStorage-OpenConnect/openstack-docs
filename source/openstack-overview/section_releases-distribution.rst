OpenStack Releases and Distributions
====================================

OpenStack’s major release cadence switched from every three months to six
months starting with the Essex release. The Wallaby release date is
tentative as of the date of this writing. Successive releases are
alphabetically incremented. Hence, the release intended for April of
2021, by convention, will start with the letter “W.”

Table 2.1: OpenStack Releases to Date

Additionally, for each major version a stable branch is maintained.
These branches represent a centralized effort to maintain bugfixes and
security vulnerability patches for released OpenStack project versions
in a ready-to-deploy form.

OpenStack is often consumed through one of a variety of prepackaged
methods (for example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux - OpenStack Platform,
Rackspace Private Cloud Software, Canonical Ubuntu, SUSE OpenStack
Cloud, Mirantis OpenStack, and a growing variety of other options).
Additional distributions or packaged appliances (for example, Nebula)
from leading technology vendors are currently under development, are in
preview, or are generally available today.

This document is intended to be broadly applicable to deployment with
distributions meeting the OpenStack Foundation’s requirements for a
compliant software distribution.
