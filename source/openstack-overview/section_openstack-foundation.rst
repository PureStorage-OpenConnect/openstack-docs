OpenStack Foundation
====================

The OpenStack Foundation promotes the development, distribution and
adoption of the OpenStack cloud operating system. The goal of the
OpenStack Foundation is to serve developers, users, and the entire
ecosystem by providing a set of shared resources to grow the footprint
of public and private OpenStack clouds, enable technology vendors
targeting the platform and assist developers in producing the best cloud
software in the industry.

Pure Storage joined as a member of the OpenStack Foundation in July
of 2014. The OpenStack Foundation is an independent body providing
shared resources to help achieve its mission by protecting, empowering,
and promoting OpenStack software and the community around it.
