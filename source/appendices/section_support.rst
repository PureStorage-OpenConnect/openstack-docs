Support
=======

Support provides support for OpenStack connections with FlashArray backends via 
the standard Pure Storage support channels by either calling +1-650-729-4088
(Global Toll Number), or going to https://support.purestorage.com/Pure1/Support
for regional support numbers, or by submitting a support request via email to
email:support@purestorage.com

Community support is available through the 'code' slack channel:
https://code-purestorage.slack.com/.

All documentation for Pure Storage's drivers for OpenStack are contained in this 
Deployment Operations Guide.  A link to the most current version can always
be found at http://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/Openstack/.

The Pure Storage OpenStack team presently intends to provide maintenance of
the three most recently released versions of OpenStack. For example,
during Wallaby development, all code that is part of the Train, Ussuri and
Victoria official branches are supported. Upon Wallaby release, direct
maintenance for Train would be dropped and maintenance for Wallaby is
added.

If your host operating system, hypervisor, and other components involved
in the data path are approved through the IMT, then as long as you are 
using an OpenStack release (or n-1) version, your configuration is supported.
See the `FlashArray compatibility Matrix <https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/Getting_Started_with_FlashArray/FlashArray_Compatibility_Matrix>_`
to verify your configuration is supported.

Pure Storage can provide customized support options for production
requirements. For more information, please contact your sales team.
