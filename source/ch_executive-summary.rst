Executive Summary
*****************

OpenStack is an open source cloud computing platform designed as an Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS) implementation. It has the ability to control large numbers
of compute, network and storage resources.

The block storage portion of OpenStack is referred to as the Cinder project
and aims to provide persistent block level storage to the OpenStack compute (Nova) instances.
The Pure Storage Cinder driver is a PythonÂ®-based module integrated into the main
OpenStack distributions.

This document intends to describe the FlashArray capabilities in a
production OpenStack deployment and to describe some of the high-level
concepts and architecture of the OpenStack platform. It is intended to be read by
system architects, system administrators and storage administrators who are investigating
or using deployments of OpenStack.
